# A german language learning environment

## Check out the current working app [here](http://shouston3.github.io/learnenv/)

## What?

* Uses an array of 400 verbs, 200 in german, 200 in english
* Has an option to select the direction of translation
* Goes through 5 words at a time, noting where you are out of the 200
* Has an option to show/hide all, next and previous words

## Why?

I would like to learn German and wanted a learning environment to do so

## Current functionality

* The home page has the option of two translation directions, but only de -> en works
* The next and prev buttons work quite well, but the prev button does not go back to the beginning when at the start
* Has a counter which displays where you are in the 200 words
* The array of 400 words is in the correct order and outputs when needed, what more can you want from an array

## Future functionality

* All buttons work fine including the option of both translation directions
* A box to check if you got an answer wrong and then a separate test for the answers you got wrong
* When familiar with node.js, be able to use backend to save mistakes log as well as reset mistakes log

## Tasks

* Refactor js to be more concise more for loops and ternary functions
* Refactor css and add mqueries to work on mobile
* Create hotkeys and a single clicker for mobile and swipe events for next and prev

## Stretch Goals

* Add backend
* Add mistakes log with mistakes test option
* Add more verbs
* Add a separate nouns option
* Add a help page for how the app works
* Add smooth transitions
